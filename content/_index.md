The aim of this project is to add all popular Bengali typing methods from Bangladesh and India in a single interface. We want to make desktop publishing in Bengali more easier and convenient. We want to boost the use of Bengali in computers. Currently we have **English to Bangla Typing** or **Phonetic typing** for home users and for professionals we have **Traditional Keyboard Layout** or **Fixed typing method**.

#### Phonetic Typing
**English to Bangla:**
OpenBangla Keyboard comes with Avro Phonetic. So like in Avro Keyboard, you can write `ami banglay gan gai` and it will convert to `আমি বাংলায় গান গাই`

**Floating Preview window:**
See on the fly how your English text is converting to Bangla!

**Dictionary Support:**
This English to Bangla phonetic typing method supports Dictionary with near about 150000 Bangla words and auto-correct feature.

#### Touch Typing
**Multiple Keyboard Layout Support:**
With OpenBangla Keyboard, you can choose your favourite layout at any time in **Layout menu** like you done in Avro Keyboard. Currently we package these layouts with OpenBangla Keyboard:

* **Probhat**
* **Munir Optima**
* **Avro Easy** - An easy to learn keyboard layout from OmicronLab.
* **Bornona** - The easiest Bangla keyboard layout we have found yet! From "The Safeworks".
* **National (Jatiya)** - Standard Bangla Keyboard Layout in Bangladesh designed by Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC).

**Automatic Vowel Forming:**
Unleash your typing speed with this great algorithm. In a good number of cases, simply typing the kar/matra/short form of vowel will produce the full form of vowel automatically, there is no need to type the Link key. This Automatic Vowel Forming can also be kept disabled from the **Settings menu**.

**Old Style “Reph”:**
Although in phonetic typing method Reph is typed at the beginning of a consonant, this may be seemed peculiar to the users (and it happened!). Like Avro Keyboard, OpenBangla Keyboard now uses the “auto Reph” feature, which will automatically move the Reph at the beginning of a consonant/"juktakkhor" (conjunct) when you type it at the end. This Old Style Reph can also be kept disabled from the **Settings menu**.

**Traditional Kar Joining:**
There are two forms of Kar joining. One is `রু` which is frequently used, but there is an another form `র‌ু` which is used in books. With this option we can write in this form as we like. This option can be enabled from the **Settings menu**.

**Avro Keyboard Layout Support:**
OpenBangla Keyboard supports the layouts file that are from Avro Keyboard. So you can use those layouts you have created with Avro Keyboard tools!

**Assamese Language Support:**
You can also type Assamese using all these keyboard layouts as necessary Assamese characters are placed here.

#### Layout Viewer
This is a must have feature for any virtual keyboard interface like OpenBangla Keyboard. But all including Microsoft seem to overlook it. With this handy tool, users can see the actual image of the current keyboard layout anytime they need. Now there is no need to print or draw a keyboard layout and attach it on your computer table!
