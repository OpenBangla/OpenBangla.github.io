We're proudly announcing the [release](https://github.com/OpenBangla/OpenBangla-Keyboard/releases/tag/1.0.0) of OpenBangla Keyboard version **1.0.0** nicknamed **Probhat(প্রভাত)**, an Open Source Bengali input method.

In Bangla **Probhat(প্রভাত)** means morning or starting of a new day. With this release we want to announce the starting of a new era of Bengali computing in Linux.

On the other hand, [Probhat](http://www.ekushey.org/?page/probhat_layout) is the name of the most used Bengali keyboard layout in Linux and found in most distros. It is designed by [Ekushey](http://www.ekushey.org/), the first project to distribute free Bengali typing tools for Windows users.

So OpenBangla Team wants to pay tribute to Ekushey team for being awesome!

This is the first stable version of OpenBangla Keyboard. So all things are new!

Download the new release from [here](http://openbangla.github.io/download) and see the [change log](https://github.com/OpenBangla/OpenBangla-Keyboard/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)!
